                    <p>You didn’t buy that Kindle book. You rented it from a digital overlord who can take it away whenever they want. And now, Amazon’s making that painfully obvious.</p>
                    <p>Starting February 26, 2025, Amazon will strip you of the ability to download and back up your purchased Kindle books. The "Download & Transfer via USB" feature? Gone. Your ability to actually own the books you paid for? Dead. From now on, your books live and die at Amazon’s discretion. If they decide to erase a title from existence, you’ll just have to accept it.</p>
                    <p>This isn’t just about DRM. It’s about control.</p>
                    <h2>The Future Is 1984 – And Amazon Holds the Eraser</h2>
                    <p>In 2009, Amazon remotely deleted copies of George Orwell’s 1984 and Animal Farm from customers’ Kindles. That should’ve been the wake-up call. Instead, people kept feeding Bezos’ machine. Now, Amazon doesn’t even have to pretend you own your books. If they decide to "update" a title, they can alter its content without your permission.</p>
                    <p>Think about that for a second. In a world where facts get labeled "misinformation" and history gets rewritten in real-time, Amazon just gave itself the power to modify books you already bought. They could change passages, remove inconvenient truths, or simply erase a book altogether. And you? You’ll have no proof the original ever existed.</p>
                    <p>This is full-blown digital censorship at a level George Orwell didn’t even dream of.</p>
                    <h2>Tech Oligarchs Want You in a Walled Garden</h2>
                    <p>Amazon isn’t alone in this. Big Tech wants everything locked down under their control. You don’t "own" your movies on streaming services. You don’t "own" your music on Spotify. And now, you won’t own your books on Kindle either. Your access to information exists at the pleasure of corporations—and they can revoke it whenever they want.</p>
                    <p>This isn’t about copyright. It’s about keeping you dependent. Amazon doesn’t want you backing up your books because if they control the pipeline, they control the message.</p>
                    <h2>The Solution? Take Back Your Library</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <ul>
                        <li>Support and use your local library. Do whatever you can to ensure public libraries stay open.</li>
                        <li>Pirate your own damn books. If you paid for it, you should be able to back it up. Tools exist to strip Amazon’s DRM and download your purchases. Use them.</li>
                        <li>Support local bookstores and independent authors. Every dollar you spend on Kindle is a vote for your own digital enslavement. Sites like Bookshop.org support real bookstores instead of funding a corporate panopticon.</li>
                        <li>Defend digital preservation. The internet is under attack, and sites like Archive.org, LibGen, and Z-Library are keeping knowledge alive. Support them before it’s too late.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Big Tech wants you to be a renter in your own digital life. Refuse. Fight back. Take control. Because if we let Amazon decide what knowledge is allowed to exist, we might wake up one day in a world where the truth itself has been deleted.</p>
