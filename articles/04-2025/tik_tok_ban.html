                    <h2>The TikTok Ban is Not For Your Privacy</h2>
                    <p>So, the U.S. government is banning TikTok. Again. They’re claiming it’s all about protecting your privacy and national security. <a href="/articles/04-2025/privacy_anon.html">Learn more about privacy and anonymity here.</a></p>
                    <p>Sure, the app collects data—so does every other platform you’ve ever used. But here’s the kicker: while politicians scream about TikTok, they’re silent about the devices already inside your home that track your every move.</p>
                    <p>Let’s be clear—this isn’t about protecting you. It’s a distraction.</p>
                    <h4>The Spy Network in Your Home</h4>
                    <p>The fact is You Paid for 24-7 Surveillance in your home willingly.</p>
                    <p>Look around. Your smart TV knows what you watch and when you watch it. That Roomba mapping your floors? It’s not just cleaning—it’s creating a blueprint of your home. Doorbell cameras and baby monitors? They’re listening and watching, sometimes even when you don’t want them to.</p>
                    <p>Smart speakers like Alexa or Google Home are always listening for their wake words, but they’re also catching bits of your conversations. Gaming consoles, smart thermostats, refrigerators, light bulbs—everything connected to the internet is collecting data. And it’s not just what you do; it’s when you do it, how you do it, and sometimes why you do it.</p>
                    <p>The worst part? These devices don’t just collect data—they share it. With corporations. With advertisers. And sometimes, with governments.</p>
                    <h4>Hypocrisy at Its Finest</h4>
                    <p>Here’s the reality: the U.S. government doesn’t care about your privacy. If they did, they’d be cracking down on the surveillance economy built into the tech we use every day. But they don’t. Instead, they’ve turned TikTok into a convenient scapegoat. Why? Because it’s foreign. Because it’s an easy target.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple are profiting off your data without much scrutiny. They’re selling your habits, preferences, and even your location to the highest bidder. And the government? They’re either complicit or willfully ignorant.</p>
                    <h4>What You Can Do To Improve Your Privacy</h4>
                    <p>You can’t wait for someone else to protect your privacy. You have to take control. Here’s how:</p>
                    <h5>Audit Your Devices</h5>
                    <p>Make a list of every internet-connected device in your home. If it doesn’t need to be online, disconnect it.</p>
                    <h5>Limit Permissions</h5>
                    <p>Go into the settings of your devices and apps. Disable unnecessary permissions, like location tracking and microphone access.</p>
                    <h5>Use a Firewall</h5>
                    <p>Install a firewall or use a privacy-focused router to block unwanted data collection.</p>
                    <h5>Opt for Open-Source Alternatives</h5>
                    <p>Whenever possible, use open-source software and hardware. These are often less invasive and more transparent.</p>
                    <h5>Regularly Update Firmware</h5>
                    <p>Keeping devices updated can patch security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.</p>
                    <h5>Audit Your Devices</h5>
                    <p>Do you really need a smart fridge? Sometimes, the best solution is going back to basics.</p>
                    <h4>Your Move</h4>
                    <p>You’re not powerless. Every choice you make—every device you buy, every setting you tweak—is a step toward reclaiming your privacy. Start small. Start today.</p>
                    <p><strong>It’s time to wake up.</strong></p>
