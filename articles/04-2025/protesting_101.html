                    <p>They want you to be afraid. They want you to stay home, to keep quiet, to believe resistance is futile. But resistance is growing. Protests are increasing in size and frequency—because they have to. The dismantling of democracy is no longer a slow creep; it’s an open-air fascist takeover. And the regime is waiting for an excuse to crack down even harder.</p>    
                    <p>Make no mistake: they will exploit any chaos, any violence—whether staged, provoked, or genuine—to justify mass arrests, surveillance expansions, and violent suppression. If you’re going to protest, you need to be prepared.</p>
                    <p><b>This is not a game. This is about survival.</b></p>
                    <p>This guide is not about ideology. It’s about how to stay anonymous, avoid getting arrested, and protect yourself from surveillance. For more on anonymity, see <a href="/articles/04-2025/privacy_anon.html">Privacy vs Anonymity</a>.</p>

                    <h2>BEFORE THE PROTEST: PREPARATION IS EVERYTHING</h2>
                    <p>Survival starts before you even step outside.</p>
                    <li><b>WHAT TO WEAR (STAY ANONYMOUS & UNTRACEABLE)</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cover all identifying features: tattoos, scars, hair, piercings.</li>
                        <li>Dark, nondescript clothing. No logos, patterns, or flashy colors.</li>
                        <li>Long sleeves, gloves, and a hood to minimize skin exposure.</li>
                        <li>A change of clothes in a sealed bag (switch after leaving).</li>
                        <li>Wear something different from your everyday shoes.</li>
                        <li>No bright colors, no unique designs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>WHAT TO BRING (Essential Gear)</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Water & snacks (stay hydrated, stay alert)</li>
                        <li>Cash (small bills; no debit/credit cards)</li>
                        <li>Medical supplies: bandages, saline, pain relievers, liquid antacid + water (for tear gas)</li>
                        <li>Emergency contacts: written on paper (NOT stored in your phone)</li>
                        <li>Several face coverings: a mask, bandana, or balaclava</li>
                        <li>Gloves: Protect your fingerprints on everything you touch</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>WHAT NOT TO BRING (Anything That Can Identify You)</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Smartphones, smartwatches, fitness trackers (LEAVE THEM HOME)</li>
                        <li>AirPods, Bluetooth devices, or anything with a unique signal</li>
                        <li>Jewelry or accessories that can link back to you</li>
                        <li>Bank cards, digital payments, or anything that creates a record of your location</li>
                        <li>Anything illegal, weapons, or objects that could be used as “evidence” against you</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>HOW TO AVOID SURVEILLANCE & TRACKING</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The most dangerous thing you can bring to a protest is a smartphone.</li>
                        <li>Even in airplane mode, your phone can be tracked.</li>
                        <li>Even with the battery removed, some devices still transmit signals.</li>
                        <li>iPhones, Samsung phones, MacBooks, and newer devices use Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) tracking to constantly ping their location to nearby devices—even when "offline.</li>
                        <li>Solution? Leave your phone at home.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you absolutely must bring a phoe: Use a burner phone, bought with cash, never used near home. Keep it off and in a Faraday bag unless absolutely needed. Do NOT use Face ID or fingerprint unlock.</p>
                    <h2>CAMERAS & PHOTOS: DO NOT DOCUMENT YOURSELF OR OTHERS</h2>
                    <p>Do not take photos or videos of the protest. Do not take photos or videos of yourself or others. Do not post anything online. Do not tag anyone. Do not use social media.</p>
                    <p>If recording police misconduct: Use a separate, dedicated camera (not your personal phone). Blur faces before sharing. Scrub metadata before uploading.</p>
                    <h3>SOCIAL MEDIA: POSTING GETS YOU TRACKED</h3>
                    <p>Do not post about the protest in real-time. Turn off location services on all apps. If posting later, remove metadata and EXIF data.</p>
                    <h2>AVOIDING ARREST & POLICE TACTICS</h2>
                    <p>You don’t need to break the law to get arrested. They will find an excuse if they want you in custody</p>
                    <h3>HOW TO AVOID BEING TARGETED</h3>
                    <p>Do not engage with police. Avoid eye contact. Stay near the edges of crowds. Avoid the front lines. Have an escape route planned in case of escalation. Move in groups. Never be alone.</p>
                    <h3>WHAT TO DO IF STOPPED OR ARRESTED</h3>
                    <p>Stay silent. Say nothing beyond identifying yourself (if required). Do not consent to searches. They may search you anyway, but never consent. Ask for a lawyer immediately. Memorize a legal hotline number. Write it on your body if necessary.</p>
                    <h2>COMMUNICATION OPTIONS: STAY OFF THE GRID</h2>
                    <p>WALKIE-TALKIES & RADIOS: USE WITH CAUTION. PROS: Work without internet, harder to track in real-time. CONS: Most are not encrypted—police can listen in. Best Practices: Use analog walkie-talkies, not digital models. Switch frequencies often. Use vague language. Never discuss real plans over the radio.</p>
                    <h2>LEAVING THE PROTEST SAFELY</h2>
                    <p>Change clothes immediately after leaving. Take indirect routes home. Avoid surveillance cameras. Do NOT post online about your participation. If questioned later, say nothing without a lawyer.</p>
                    <h2>FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>
                    <p><b>This is not paranoia, this is reality.</b>Every protest that grows in size brings us closer to a tipping point—and the regime is waiting for an excuse to crush resistance before it solidifies. They will use surveillance, infiltration, and provocation to justify mass arrests and violent crackdowns. Do not make it easy for them. Be prepared. Stay anonymous. Protect yourself and each other. The world is watching. The fight is not over. Stay safe.</p>
