                    <p>The U.S. Constitution isn’t perfect. No foundation is. But it remains one of the most ambitious blueprints for democracy—a declaration that power should belong to the people, not the few. It was built with the hope that all individuals, regardless of race, sex, or background, could shape their own future. And while the forces of control would love for you to believe that hope is lost, I’m here to tell you: it’s not.</p>
<p>Democracy doesn’t survive on wishful thinking or angry posts. It’s built, reinforced, and defended by action. Right now, too many local councils, school boards, and city governments are being taken over by extremists. The answer? Show up. Run for office. Attend meetings. Hold those in power accountable. They count on you staying home. Prove them wrong.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t stop there. Organization is the backbone of resistance. Across the world, people flood the streets to demand justice—yet in the U.S., silence hangs where outrage should be. That silence is exactly what those in power want. Break it. Protest. Unionize. Strike. Demand better from corporations, from lawmakers, from your neighbors. The best time to act was yesterday. The second best time is now.</p>
<p>We are preserving and uploading this copy of the U.S. Constitution because history is being rewritten in real time. The current administration has erased it from the official White House website, alongside records of the January 6th insurrection, Spanish-language resources, and other critical documents. But information is power, and we refuse to let it be buried.</p>
