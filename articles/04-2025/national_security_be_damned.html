                    <h2>National Security Be Damned - Trump Fires DHS Experts</h2>
                    <p>Oh, you thought we were safe? Think again. The Department of Homeland Security just took a flamethrower to its advisory committees, including the Cyber Safety Review Board—you know, the folks investigating a MAJOR Chinese hack of US telecom giants. Why? Because the Trump administration decided it’s better to play budgetary dress-up than protect national security. This is what happens when your priorities are as backward as a VHS tape in 2025.</p>
                    <p>Let’s break it down. The Cyber Safety Review Board, a Biden-era initiative, was tasked with investigating significant cybersecurity incidents. <a href="/articles/04-2025/privacy_anon.html">Learn more about privacy and security here.</a> Recently, it’s been digging into Salt Typhoon, a Chinese hacking group that breached major telecom providers like Verizon and AT&T. They stole call records and even accessed communications involving Trump himself, Vice President JD Vance, and other government officials. Let that sink in. China’s running laps around our phone systems, and DHS’s response? “Let’s fire everyone and start over.” Brilliant.</p>
                    <h4>Eliminating the Misuse of Resources</h4>
                    <p>DHS Acting Secretary Benjamin Huffman’s memo claims this move is about “eliminating the misuse of resources” and focusing on “national security.” But how exactly does dismantling a critical cybersecurity board mid-investigation prioritize security? Spoiler: it doesn’t. This is nothing more than a political stunt to gut oversight and stack the deck with loyalists who’ll do nothing but nod and clap. Meanwhile, the Chinese hackers are popping champagne.</p>
                    <p>Oh, and let’s not forget the hypocrisy. The same administration that’s been screaming about TikTok and Chinese surveillance just handed Beijing a gift-wrapped pass to keep digging through our telecoms. They’re out here banning apps and crying about spyware while literally dismantling the infrastructure designed to stop actual espionage. You couldn’t script this level of absurdity.</p>
                    <h4>National Security Be Damned</h4>
                    <p>Democrats are sounding the alarm, with Rep. Bennie Thompson pointing out the obvious: this is a deliberate attempt to sabotage the Cyber Safety Review Board’s investigation. And he’s right. This isn’t about cost-cutting; it’s about power-grabbing. The administration wants to replace experts with yes-men who’ll turn a blind eye to anything that doesn’t fit their narrative. National security be dam</p>
                    <p>Even the conservative Heritage Foundation is piling on, accusing CISA (the agency overseeing the board) of being a “censoring and election engineering apparatus of the political Left.” Translation: “We don’t like being held accountable, so let’s burn it all down.”</p>
                    <p>And here’s the kicker: the Cyber Safety Review Board was less than halfway through its investigation. According to former members, the work isn’t just delayed—it’s dead. Other advisory boards, including those focused on AI safety and critical infrastructure, were also axed. This isn’t just short-sighted; it’s dangerous. These boards exist to protect us from threats that most people can’t even comprehend. But hey, who needs experts when you have Twitter warriors and conspiracy theorists running the show?</p>
                    <p>So, where does that leave us? Vulnerable. While DHS plays musical chairs with our security, the Chinese hackers are already planning their next move. And when the next breach happens—because it will—don’t ask how it could’ve been prevented. We already know the answer: it could’ve been stopped if we hadn’t let political egos and incompetence gut the very systems designed to protect us.</p>
                    <p>This isn’t just a failure; it’s a betrayal. And the worst part? It’s exactly the kind of hypocritical, self-serving bullshit we’ve come to expect. Buckle up, folks. The next four years are going to be a masterclass in how to fumble national security while crying about TikTok dances.</p>
