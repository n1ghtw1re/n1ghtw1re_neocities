                    <p>The first issue of the zine has arrived, and it’s not pulling punches. ImVexd here, bringing you the first call to arms in the fight for <a href="/articles/04-2025/manifesto_liberation.html">digital freedom</a>. We’re kicking things off with a manifesto that lays the foundation for everything we’re about—reclaiming the autonomy that’s been stolen from us, dismantling systems of control, and awakening the masses to the fight ahead. If you’ve been feeling the weight of surveillance, corporate greed, and the slow creep of fascism online, this issue is your first step toward understanding the battle lines.</p>
                    <p>Within these pages, we define the hypersigil and give you the tools to fight back. The first card in the Hacker’s Tarot, "The User," begins our journey into the world of digital sovereignty. We’ll show you how to break free from the control of Big Tech, starting with understanding the vast network of manipulation you’re part of. We dive deep into the most chilling incidents of the year, with the Corporate Hall of Shame and the catastrophic data breaches that should have had everyone questioning who owns your information. If you’re not angry yet, the Dead Internet report will get your blood boiling as Meta’s AI-driven profiles try to erase real humans from the digital landscape.</p>
                    <p>But we’re not just about problems—we’re here with solutions too. Learn how to run an offline copy of Wikipedia using Kiwix, dig into the end of net neutrality, and explore the tools you’ll need to keep control of your data in a world increasingly determined to take it from you. This issue isn’t just information; it’s a blueprint for resistance. If you’re ready to take action, keep reading. We’ve only just begun.</p>
