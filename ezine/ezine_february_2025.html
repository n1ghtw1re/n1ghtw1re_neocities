                    <p>Welcome to the February issue, where we continue to peel back the layers of control and reveal the hidden truths of the digital age. ImVexd here, and this month we’re diving even deeper into the chaos, with a focus on the hijacking of America and the systems pulling the strings behind the curtain. We’ll take you through the reality of this modern world, showing you how to hack the very fabric of what we perceive as real. It’s time to disrupt the narratives that have been built to control us—because reality is just another system waiting to be hacked.</p>
                    <p>In this issue, we’ll explore how Open Source is the true key to winning the AI race and why it’s the only thing standing between freedom and surveillance. The Promises of the Internet are up for debate as we examine how far we’ve strayed from the utopian ideals that once powered the web. Fascism Watch 2.0 picks up right where we left off, highlighting the creeping authoritarianism that’s taking hold in every corner of the globe. We’re also tackling the delicate balance between <a href="/articles/04-2025/privacy_anon.html">privacy and anonymity</a> in a world where both are constantly under siege. And if you’ve been wondering about Mastodon and how to escape the clutches of Big Tech, we’ve got you covered with a practical guide to using this decentralized platform.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the journey doesn’t stop there. The Hacker’s Tarot continues with "The Creator," exploring the power to shape and create within a broken system. We’re also keeping a close eye on the current admin and their relentless purge of official websites—an unsettling sign of the state of online freedom. And if you’re not yet worried about the state of the world, the Doomsday Clock is getting dangerously close to midnight. As always, this issue is packed with insight, action, and a call to resist. Are you ready to step up? The revolution is unfolding, and it’s happening now.</p>
